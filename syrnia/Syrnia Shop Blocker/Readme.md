"a checkbox added in shops, which would add it to an 'ignore shop' list" - Orange



I remember many times being annoyed by shops that have only high priced items in them. After reading the recent thread about these shops, and Orange's post, I decided to make an extension that allows people to choose to ignore them by simply clicking a red X on the shop list.

<h3>Features</h3>

Block and unblock from the shop list.
Hides blocked shops from shop list and search results.
Allows temporary unhiding.
