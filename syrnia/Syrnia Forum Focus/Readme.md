Syrnia Forum Focus
==================

Last update Jan 28, 2009

Allows the colouring of the last 30 replies and blocking of categories.


<h3 name="overview">Overview</h3>

Because Syrnia has such an awful forum I thought I'd make it a bit better. Right now it doesn't do much but there are quite a few things planned.

<h3>Updates</h3>

1.0 Initial build.
1.1 Addition of colour picker, reorganization of code.
1.2 Addition of last post links.
1.3 Resizes Option's window properly if you use the popups

<h3>Upgrade Warning</h3>
Upgrading from 1.0 to 1.1 or above will wipe your settings as I needed to restructure a lot.

In the future this shouldn't happen.

<h3>Known Bugs</h3>

Lots of flickering on the options page when choosing or changing colors. Can't think of a good way to stop this though but I'm thinking on it.

<h3>ToDo List</h3>

<u><i>Add a Rich text editor</i></u>

Allow text, lists, emotes to be edited graphically.

I've been thinking of using WYMeditor: http://files.wymeditor.org/wymeditor/trunk/src/examples/01-basic.html

What I like about it is the making of lists which right now is damn hard to do currently.

The menu items that couldn't be used (most of them) would be removed. 

Progress: Modifying WYMeditor code to be compatible with syrnia.

<u><i>Parse URLs</i></u>
Parse URLs (http://www.example.com) so they are clickable.

<u><i>Categories in last 30</i></u>
Make a link directed to the category.

<u><i>Show last page on post</i></u>
After you post in a thread it shows what you just posted instead of going back to the first page of the thread.

<u><i>Show last post link on last 30 replies</i></u>
Add a link on the last 30 replies saying '[go to last post]' that takes you to the last post instead of the first page.

<u><i>Sortable threads table</i></u>
The tables that show the threads in a category could be made to be sortable. This would make it possible to easally see which is the oldest thread, the most popular and such.

<u><i>Show which posts you have read before</i></u>
Change the colours of threads which you have already read. This is really simple and all browsers do this by default but syrnia overrides it by making all links red.

<u><i>Block individual threads</i></u>
Like I do with the my Shop Blocker extension I could add the blocking of threads. This would be good for people that don't want to see my Wonderful Rate The Avatar Forum Game but want to see the other threads that are in off topic appear in the last 30 replies.

<u><i>Block a players posts</i></u>
Hide the contents of a persons post if they are on your block list with a button to temporarily show the post. 

<u><i>Auto updating last 30 replies</i></u>
Make it so that the last 30 replies automatically updates to show the latest posts without you needing to reload the page.

<u><i>Custom Emotes</i></u>
Make it so that the last 30 replies automatically updates to show the latest posts without you needing to reload the page.

<u><i>Player Names</i></u>
Make player names clickable and directed at syrnia page by default with option to direct to DW-HQ. Make sure this doesn't conflict with "Minor Syrnia Tweaks".

<u><i>Clan Tags</i></u>
Make tags clickable and directed at syrnia clan page by default with option to direct to DW-HQ. Make sure this doesn't conflict with "Minor Syrnia Tweaks".

- last post image instead of link.
- a part to customize chat colours, in your layout tweaks script.
