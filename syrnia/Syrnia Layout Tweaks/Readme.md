Syrnia Layout Tweaks
====================
Last update May 4, 2008 


*OLD*

Makes things slightly more purdy.

This is an old script that I haven't updated in a while. I may update it at a later stage depending upon the need.

<hr />

(Experimental)

Adds a menu when you right click on player names in the player list as well as fixes a few other annoyances.

If you don't know what Syrnia is then you won't find this much use.

The only Downfall is The Chat Colours are a Bit messed up (Last time i Checked, Before Ciarans Script)
