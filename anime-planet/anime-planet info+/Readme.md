Request for want to watch anime

Hello AnnanFay,

I'm using your script for a couple of weeks now and it's really nice to use. I've been looking for those features for about half a year now and I'm glad I found it. (see http://www.anime-planet.com/forum/showthread.php?t=196675)

Could you please consider adding the following options ?

1- If the "want to watch" status is selected and the only available statuses are "" "want to watch" and "won't watch" then fade the entry away as there is no episode released yet.

2- If the "want to watch" status is selected and the "watched" status is not available then display an "Ongoing" or "New" tag.

3- If the "want to watch" status is selected and the "watching" status is available then display a [total episode count] tag.

Kind Regards
M
