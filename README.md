userscripts
===========

This is just took a quick copy-paste dump of everything I could find of mine from the userscripts.org website.

The 'userscript.js' files are the latest version while the numbered files represent userscript.org internal IDs. I assume they are in ascending order. If I have time later I will do some git fiddly to insert them into the history properly.
