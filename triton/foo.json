    "galactic_news": "\n<em>Aggressive AI - 23 April 2015</em>  <p> All new games now have an AI that\nwill more actively defend itself and can even launch attacks. </p> <p> You can\nmanage your relationship with the AI somewhat by sending them technology and\ncash. There is a new section on the Empire Screen for AI's that shows what an\nAI thinks of you. </p>\n\n<em>Allied Combat - 27 March 2015</em>  <p> All new games starting today will\nuse a new combat algorithm that allows multiple players to defend a star. </p>\n<p> In games that have Formal Alliances enabled, you can now jump thought\nallied stars and participate in combat to help defend them. </p><p>You can\nalso stage joint attacks where your carrier will work together to take down\nenemy stars.</p> <p> This important change is the first step along the road\nto proper support for team games.</p>\n\n<em>Ships Production Limit - 16 March 2015</em> <p> To encourage players to\nget into combat we are placing a limit on ship production when a player has\ntoo many ships  parked in orbit of a star. When a player has more than 100\ntimes the natural resources of a star in ships in orbit, the production of new\nships will be suspended. Engage the enemy!</p> <p>Also, due to popular demand,\nyou can miss six turns rather than three before being kicked for inactivity in\nturn based games. UPDATE: This rule has been pulled for now as a response to\nsome good feedback on the forum.  </p>\n\n<em>New 64 Player Map / Production Times - 3 August 2014</em>  <p> We are\ntesting a new 64 player map. The old donut has been retired because it was to\ndifficult for a number of smaller players to bring down a large player getting\nclose to the 25% victory. You can read about the new map and offer your\nfeedback on the <a href='http://forum.ironhelmet.com/t/64-player-map-\ndesign/3935'>forum.</a></p>\n\n<p>We have also added the ability to modify the production period.\nInstead of the standard 24 hours, you can choose from a variety of times from\n18 to 36. By altering the production period you can ensure\nthat the time-of-day that production occurs is different each day.</p>\n\n<p> The first few test games are under-way, and if successful, we will\nchange the default production period to something other than 24 hours.</p>\n\n<em>Scan Trade and Formal Alliances - 3 July 2014</em> <p> We have fixed the\nloophole that allowed you to trade with player on the other side of the Galaxy\nif you had a Formal Alliance with them. From now on, when the Scan Trade\nrestriction is enabled, you must be able to directly see a player to trade\nwith them.</p>\n\n<em>Chain Ruler - 2 July 2014</em> <p>Very special thanks to <em>Dakota\nHawkins</em> for a huge improvement to the ruler. You can now select a list of\nstars and calculate the ETA of a full path</p>\n<p> We are also working to improve the Badge and we are in the process\nof implementing a Galactic Credit system so you don't have to whip out your credit card\nevery time you want to buy one for a player you enjoying playing against.</p>\n\n<em>Star Abandonment - 10 June 2014</em> <p> A small change today so that you\ncan only abandon one star each production period. We hope\nthis will prevent weaker players simply abandoning whole empires to allies\nbefore they quit.</p>\n\n<em>Trade Options - 23 May 2014</em> <p> You can now specify the cost of\ntechnology trades when starting games. The options are $5, $15, $25, and $50\nper level.</p><p>We also have a new feature that, when enabled, prevents\ntrading with players that are not within your scanning range. We hope that\nthis will make trade far more interesting in large games. </p>\n\n<em>New Menu - 6 May 2014</em> <p> A rework of the main menu should make\nthe game a little simpler to navigate for a new player. The new design will allow us to\nstart adding new features in a cleaner more contained way.</p>\n\n<em>Custom Galaxies - 26 March 2014</em> <p> Custom home star placement is a new\nexperimental feature is available to test in today's build. You can now\nprovide a set of coordinates for the placement of each players home star. You\ncould create spiral galaxies, linear galaxies or all kinds of crazy shapes. If\nyou have a great idea for a galaxy, please head on over to the forum and let\nus know. </p>\n\n<em>Read and unread messages - 26 February 2014</em> <p> We have changed the\ncode that tracks whether or not you have read a message. We hope it will be\nfaster and more accurate.</p> <p> One side effect of the change is that all\nyou existing messages may be marked as unread. You may need to use the \"Mark\nAll Read\" button a few times.</p>\n\n<em>New Account System - 25 February 2014</em> <p> Today we have unrolled\nchanges to the account system so that you don't have to use a social network\nto login. If you were previously using a social network, you can add a new\npassword to your account and start logging in simply using your email\naddress.</p>\n\n<em>New forum and minor fixes - 5 February 2014</em>  <p> We'll its only been\n3 years, but Iron Helmet finally has an official forum. Come and meet other\nfans of the game, talk strategy, suggest new features, and point out bugs.</p>\n<p> <a href=\"http://forum.ironhelmet.com \"> http://forum.ironhelmet.com\n</a></p> <p> Some other minor fixes. Dashed lines for looping fleets. You can\npress the E key to bring up player names over stars. Stuff like that.</p>\n\n<em>Turn Based Game Fixes - 25 January 2014</em> <p>A few small bug fixes for\nturn-based games today. You can no longer see when an enemy creates new\ncarriers, moves ships to and from carriers, and if they buy a warp gate until\nthe the start of the next turn. </p>\n\n<em>Stars for Victory - 5 January 2014</em> <p>A small new feature allows you\nto choose what percentage of stars in the galaxy must be captured for victory.\nThe default for the 64 player games will now be only 25%</p> <p>No existing\ngames will be affected.</p>\n",
