Hex Parser

Last update Feb 1, 2009 

Parses the page for Hex values and colours them

The first version I uploaded didn't work, I wouldn't have mentioned this if three people hadn't happened to install it before I fixed the bug.

Also it should be noted that this doesn't work on ajax sites or the userscript source view. not sure why it doesn't work on the source view but it's probably got something to do with it's own highlighting.

01/02/09: Fixed it searching and replacing within style and script tags.
01/02/09: Fixed it stopping before the end of the page
01/02/09: Rewrote it. As a side effect it fixed the white display bug.

Works with:

#FFF
#000
#905
#FF5500
#110055
#45FFF0
